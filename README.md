# "It's a marathon, not a sprint."
I chose to make this repository public because I believe that by doing so, I
potentially let someone else stumble upon who may find something useful, and
because it is easier to share with others.


This repository will slowly grow as I continue to work with Swift, and I hope
that I can keep a steady progress.


I have decided to start my journey off with the *100 Days of Swift* series by
[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), whom I also took the quote from
in the section heading. It's a neat little series that I tried before, and
failed at completing.. So here's to another attempt!

## 100 Days of Swift
[100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) is a series by
[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), in which he goes from the very
beginnings introducing Swift as a language and programming in general, before
moving on to projects. While I have experience with programming, I will stay
faithful to the idea, and tackle it as if I was completely new to programming.
This way, I hope to better be able to figure out if I think it's a good resource
in the end.
